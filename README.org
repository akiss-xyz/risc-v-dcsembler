* Hello!
This is dcsembler, a basic assembler for the DCS's (Department of Computer Science)
FPGA soft-core RISC-V project in 2022.

This forms part of the software tooling for the project.
* Build instructions
The project is built using CMake, so you'll need that.

Then, there are handy scripts to help you configure and build and run/test the project.

You can use ~configure.sh~ to run CMake automatically, or ~configure-gui.sh~ to get a terminal interface for the same.

Then, you're free to ~build.sh~ and ~run.sh~ away!
